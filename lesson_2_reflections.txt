What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Git has hidden files which keeps information about reposatory in ".git" folder.
  To add this information, we use git init command.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
- Suppose we have working directory in which project has been added with lots of changes. We will not add those changes 
  at one go. To do multiple logical commits, we pass the files that we want to commit to middleman - staging stage.
  Then we coomit files from stating area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
