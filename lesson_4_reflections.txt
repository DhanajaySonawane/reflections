Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- 	Fork  -> To copy repository from other's GitHub account (cloning from other GitHub account)
	Clone -> To copy repository from Github account to local machine
	Branch-> To make versions of projects

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- If we don't do so,then we will end up with more number of merge conflicts which will be annoying to resplve.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- We can use SVN to work collaborately on project. But, SVN only supports check-in, check-out option.
  It does not provide version control.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?What benefits 
does each approach have?
- If we want to collaborately make changes with large number of people, then we should do it derectly with master braanch.
  But, this has disadvantage. If some error occurs, it will directly affect on master branch.
  On other hand, if only few person going to work on new feature,then they should work on new branch. Since with less
  number of people, it is easy to handle merge pull request on GitHub. So. whether to make change on mster or 
  separate branch depends on number of people working on it.
