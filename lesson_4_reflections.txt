Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- 	Fork  -> To copy repository from other's GitHub account (cloning from other GitHub account)
	Clone -> To copy repository from Github account to local machine
	Branch-> To make versions of projects

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- If we don't do so,then we will end up with more number of merge conflicts which will be annoying to resplve.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- We can use SVN to work collaborately on project. But, SVN only supports check-in, check-out option.
  It does not provide version control.
