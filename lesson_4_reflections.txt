Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- 	Fork  -> To copy repository from other's GitHub account (cloning from other GitHub account)
	Clone -> To copy repository from Github account to local machine
	Branch-> To make versions of projects

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- If we don't do so,then we will end up with more number of merge conflicts which will be annoying to resplve.
